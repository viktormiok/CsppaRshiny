## R-Shiny App for Cellular Spatial Point Pattern Analysis
The R shiny app for machine learning analysis and visualisation of cellular spatial point patterns under hypercaloric diet shifts.

The application performs 3D and 2D for visualisation of spatial point pattern density plots, allowing flexibility in order to represent the data and emphasize the question of interest. Further it allows for performing overall and local significance analysis of spatial point pattern densities, employing several statistical approaches.

K Nearest Neighbour and Random Forest classification algorithms are implemented to compare the grouping of the cells expressing different markers within and between the diets. On top of the, correlation and spatial auto-correlation of the cells expressing different markets can be compared using Mentel and Moran I test, respectively.

## How to Run the App
If you downloaded the app locally, have all the dependencies, and wish to run it, simply open the app.R file in RStudio and click the Run App button.
